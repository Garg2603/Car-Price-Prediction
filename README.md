# Car-Price-Prediction
The project involves predicting used car prices using a Kaggle dataset. The initial steps include importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, and splitting it into train and test sets. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted, addressing columns like Name, Location, Year, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Owner_Type, Kilometers_Driven, Mileage, Engine, Power, Seats, and New_Price. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, extracting relevant information, and creating dummy variables for categorical columns. Finally, the dataset is scaled, and Linear Regression and Random Forest models are trained, with the Random Forest model yielding the best performance with an R2 score of 0.88.
